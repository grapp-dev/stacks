> A set of components for building layouts in React Native. Powered by [React Native Unistyles](https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles).

`Stacks` primarily aims to simplify building and maintaining layouts, making it quick and easy. It follows a design principle that suggests components should not include any surrounding white space. Instead, layout components should solely own spacing between elements.
